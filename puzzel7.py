"""
Write a Python function that generates a random password. The password should have a random length of between 7 and 10 characters.
Each character should be randomly selected from positions 33 to 126 in the ASCII table. Your function will not take any parameters. It will return the randomly generated password as its only result.
Display the randomly generated password in your fileâ€™s main program. Your main program should only run when your solution has not been imported into another file.

"""
In this Puzzle you will write a Python function that determines whether or not a password is good.
We will define a good password to be a one that is:
- at least 8 characters long
- contains at least one uppercase letter
- at least one lowercase letter
- at least one number.
Your function should return true if the password passed to it as its only parameter is good.
Otherwise it should return false. Include a main program that reads a password from the user and reports whether or not it is good.
Ensure that your main program only runs when your solution has not been imported into another file.

Using your solutions to Puzzle 7 & 8, write a program that generates a random good password and displays it.
Count and display the number of attempts that were needed before a good password was generated.
Structure your solution so that it imports the functions you wrote previously and then calls them from a function named main in the file that you create for this exercise.
